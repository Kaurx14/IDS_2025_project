# “Will they pay?” - predicting loan bayback
### Kaur Vadi, Tregert Värv, Group - B8


## 1. Motivation and Goal

In this project, we study a synthetic loan dataset provided by Kaggle (Playground Series S5E11) that includes borrower demographics, financial information, loan attributes and credit history. The main aim is to predict whether a borrower will successfully repay their loan. When a borrower fails to fully repay their loan, the loan is considered to have defaulted.

To achieve this, we evaluate several machine learning models and compare their ability to predict loan repayment outcomes. Our goal is to identify which approach performs best and what factors contribute most to repayment likelihood.

## 2. Dataset

We use the dataset from the Kaggle Playground Series S5E11 competition, originally based on the “Loan Prediction Dataset – 2025”.

- The dataset contains aroud 594 000 rows and 13 features.
- It includes borrower demographics, loan details and financial indicators.  
- The target variable is loan_paid_back (1 = repaid, 0 = defaulted).  
- The dataset contains no missing values and is already cleaned.
